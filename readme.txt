INFS 3610 - Human Computer Interactions
Fall 2012
Final Project

written by
Neil Everdell

This is my final project for my HCI course.  This will be used primarily to learn how to use GitHub with an actual working example.  

This project will be written entirely in VB using Visual Studio 2010 as that's what I can get using Microsoft's DreamSpark program.

PLAN FOR TESTING:
-The individual sits down in front of the terminal with the application.  
-I will read a brief statement about what they're doing, some quick instructions and hand them a folder with 12 different items.  
-Each of the twelve items will have which interface they are to be used on and the information to be entered.  
-After all twelve are entered, a summary page will be shown with a number of questions to answer
-The user will answer the qestions and submit them.
-Finally, the user will answer a questionnaire about each interface.
