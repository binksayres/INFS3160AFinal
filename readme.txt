INFS 3610 - Human Computer Interactions
Fall 2012
Final Project

written by
Neil Everdell

	This is my final project for my HCI course.  This will be used primarily to learn how to use GitHub with an actual working example.  

This project will be written entirely in VB using Visual Studio 2010 as that's what I can get using Microsoft's DreamSpark program.
